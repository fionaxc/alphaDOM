# AlphaDOM

## Overview

AlphaDOM is a project by Fiona Cai and Kevin Jiang aimed at building a Deep Reinforcement Learning AI to play Dominion! Dominion is a deck-building card game where players compete to accumulate the most victory points by purchasing cards from a shared supply and strategically building their personal deck to optimize their actions, buys, and overall strategy.
